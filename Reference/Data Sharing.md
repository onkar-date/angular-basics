In Angular, data sharing between components can be achieved in several ways, including:

# Input/Output

1. Components can communicate with each other using input and output bindings.
2. This involves passing data from a parent component to a child component through the child component's input properties, and receiving data from the child component through output properties.
3. This is useful for passing data between related components in a parent-child hierarchy.

# Services

1. Angular services are singleton objects that can be injected into any component or service.
2. Services are often used to share data between unrelated components or to provide a common functionality across the application.
3. A service can store data and provide methods for getting and setting that data.

# Local storage

1. Local storage is a built-in browser feature that allows you to store key-value pairs in the user's browser.
2. You can use local storage to persist data between page refreshes and even between sessions.

# State management libraries

1. State management libraries like NgRx, Akita, and Redux provide a centralized store for managing application state.
2. These libraries allow components to access and modify application state in a predictable and controlled way.
